      "Keywords—LSTM, NLP, OpenCV, OBS\n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\nGlobally, an estimated 466 million people have disabling hearing loss, with 34 million being children (WHO, 2021). This population primarily relies on sign language for communication, creating a significant barrier when interacting with the hearing community.\n\nTraditional methods for bridging this communication gap involve human sign language interpreters, which are often limited in availability and incur high costs. While advancements in machine learning have led to the development of automated sign language translation tools, these models often struggle with accuracy, particularly when encountering non-standard signs, idiomatic expressions, and variations in regional dialects (e.g., [Camgoz et al., 2022]). Additionally, some existing solutions lack real-time capabilities, hindering the flow of natural conversation.",
      "The foremost goal of SignScribe is to give an accurate and user-friendly translation app which is available to both hearing and deaf individuals. For now, the project is focused on English and American Sign Language, but in future project plans to involve other languages also. Other than focusing on the accuracy part, it also recognizes limitations such as idiomatic expressions and regional dialects which put ups ongoing challenges. For ensuring that SignScribe meets all the needs of the users and reduce the gap between the communities, continuous improvements and updates needs to be done to address these issues.",

      "Easy and quick communication makes SignScribe innovative. It also gives strength to the users to take charge of their interactions and makes them the more welcoming community. For reducing the communication gap between to those who use spoken languages and the deaf community, SignScribe is a pioneering application build for them.
