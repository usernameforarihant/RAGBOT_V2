    "content": "A Random Forest is an ensemble of Decision Trees, typically trained using the bagging method. It introduces extra randomness by searching for the best feature among a random subset of features when splitting a node, rather than the very best feature. This results in greater tree diversity, trading higher bias for lower variance, which generally yields a better overall model. \n\nTo create a Random Forest, you can use the `RandomForestClassifier` class, which is optimized for Decision Trees. For example, you can train a Random Forest classifier with the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nrnd_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=500, max_leaf_nodes=16, n_jobs=-1)\nrnd_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred_rf = rnd_clf.predict(X_test)\n```\n\nThe Random Forest algorithm aggregates the predictions of multiple trees to improve accuracy, similar to the concept of the \"wisdom of the crowd.\"",

      "CHAPTER 7\nEnsemble Learning and Random Forests\nSuppose you ask a complex question to thousands of random people, then aggregate\ntheir answers. In many cases you will find that this aggregated answer is better than\nan expert’s answer. This is called the wisdom of the crowd. Similarly, if you aggregate\nthe predictions of a group of predictors (such as classifiers or regressors), you will\noften get better predictions than with the best individual predictor. A group of pre‐\ndictors is called an ensemble; thus, this technique is called Ensemble Learning, and an\nEnsemble Learning algorithm is called an Ensemble method.\nFor example, you can train a group of Decision Tree classifiers, each on a different\nrandom subset of the training set. To make predictions, you just obtain the predic‐\ntions of all individual trees, then predict the class that gets the most votes (see the last\nexercise in Chapter 6). Such an ensemble of Decision Trees is called a Random Forest,",
