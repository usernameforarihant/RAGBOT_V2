The result was **468**.\n\n2. **Method 2**: I used the `groupby` function to group the data by `Sex` and `Survived`, then counted the occurrences of each group. I specifically accessed the count for males who did not survive (0). This also resulted in **468**.\n\nBoth methods provided the same result, confirming the accuracy of the answer. The relevant columns used in these calculations were `Sex` and `Survived`."

I then counted the number of rows that met these criteria, resulting in **105** females.\n\n2. **Method 2**: I used the `groupby` function to group the data by `Sex` and `Survived`, and then applied a filter to count the number of females under 30 who survived. This also yielded **105** females.\n\nBoth methods provided the same result, confirming the accuracy of the answer. The relevant columns used in these calculations were `Sex`, `Age`, and `Survived`."

    "content": "### Details about Miss. Helen Monypeny\n\nAfter analyzing the dataframe, I found the details for Miss. Helen Monypeny using two different methods. Both methods yielded the same result, confirming the accuracy of the information.\n\n#### Method 1: Filtering by Name\nUsing the `str.contains` method, I filtered the dataframe to find the entry for Miss. Helen Monypeny. The details are as follows:\n\n- **PassengerId**: 137\n- **Survived**: 1\n- **Pclass**: 1\n- **Name**: Newsom, Miss. Helen Monypeny\n- **Sex**: female\n- **Age**: 19.0\n- **SibSp**: 0\n- **Parch**: 2\n- **Ticket**: 11752\n- **Fare**: 26.2833\n- **Cabin**: D47\n- **Embarked**: S\n\n#### Method 2: Using iloc\nIn the second method, I used `iloc` to access the same row based on the index of the filtered dataframe. The results were identical to the first method.\n\n### Final Answer\nMiss. Helen Monypeny is a female passenger with the following details:\n- **PassengerId**: 137\n- **Survived**: 1 (indicating she survived)\n- **Pclass**: 1 (indicating she was in first class)\n- **Age**: 19 years\n- **SibSp**: 0 (indicating she had no siblings or spouses aboard)\n- **Parch**: 2 (indicating she had 2 parents or children aboard)\n- **Ticket**: 11752\n- **Fare**: 26.2833\n- **Cabin**: D47\n- **Embarked**: S (indicating she boarded from Southampton)\n\n### Explanation:\nI used the following column names to extract the information:\n- **Name**: to identify the passenger\n- **PassengerId**, **Survived**, **Pclass**, **Age**, **SibSp**, **Parch**, **Ticket**, **Fare**, **Cabin**, **Embarked**: to gather all relevant details about her. \n\nBoth methods confirmed the same details, ensuring the accuracy of the information provided."

The result indicated that there are 891 rows and 12 columns.\n\n2. **Second Method**: I calculated the number of rows using `len(df)` and the number of columns using `len(df.columns)`. This method also confirmed that there are 891 rows and 12 columns.\n\nBoth methods yielded the same result, confirming the accuracy of the answer. The column names used in the second method were derived from the dataframe's structure, which includes: `PassengerId`, `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Ticket`, `Fare`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`."
