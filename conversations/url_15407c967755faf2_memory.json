    "content": "The blog appears to discuss the rejection of divisive and nonsensical terms used by certain individuals in the tech community, particularly in relation to the Ruby community. David Heinemeier Hansson expresses frustration with these \"divisive clowns\" and emphasizes the importance of ignoring them and continuing to build. He mentions the overwhelming support from the community against these negative influences, indicating a shift where people feel more empowered to speak out against them. This is highlighted in the quote from Tobi from Shopify about the mental tax on builders caused by such divisive rhetoric.",
